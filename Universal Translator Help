If it's your first use, you will need to get a key from Yandex website. It is stored in a notecard. Key usage is limited, so remove the key notecard before giving translator to somebody else.

The translator will detect your language when you speak and adjust accordingly.

Click on the translator to choose language, opt out to stop receiving translations.

If another translator is detected in the area, they will negociate and only one of them will actually process translations, avoiding chat flooding by multiple translators.
