Universal Translator, Yandex Edition, v1.0.5
© 2016 Gudule Lapointe
Based on Universal Translator 1.9.0 (Google) ©2006-2009 Hank Ramos

It is based on the excellent Universal Translator by Hank Ramos.
However, the initial version was using Google translation engine API
and Google decided to switch to a paid license. So I rewrote some
parts of the code to use Yandex engine instead.

New features
============
- It's working! No kidding: the version available on LSL scripts wiki
and on other sites like Outworldz is incomplete and not ready to work,
even taking apart the Google license issue.
- Use Yandex translation API. It is not only free (while
Google isn't anymore) and free, but it is easy to get an API key
(while it's quite complicate with Google or Microsoft API's).
- The API key is not hardcoded but instead stored in a notecard. This
avoids a single key being spread everywhere and causing "maximum
allowed requests reached" kind of messages.
DO NOT DISTRIBUTE THE TRANSLATOR WITH THE API KEY. It could end up
being used by dozens of users, and becoming useless.

Main (and not so new) features
==============================
- Multiplex mode: if several translators are in the same area, one
becomes the master and makes actual translation requests for the
other ones. This avoid overload when lot of people are present and
using it.
- Speaker language auto detection (though users can also choose
their language manually)
- Translations sent by instant messages, no spam on the public channel
- Can be used as an object in the parcel or as a HUD.
- Can use both an object in the parcel and people wearing HUD, without
spamming public channel, nor overloading the servers and the API key
limits.

To do
=====
- Get an updated list of available languages
- A beautiful texture and logo
- Detect the most used languages and show them at beginning of the list
- Allow to set a fixed list of prefferred languages to show first
(probably before the auto-detected mostly used ones).

Notes
=====
We use a dedicated function json2List instead of llJson2List (not
compatible with 0.8). It's a little bit rough, but it works.
